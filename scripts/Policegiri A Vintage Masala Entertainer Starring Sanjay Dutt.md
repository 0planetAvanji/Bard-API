The film was released on July 5, 2013 and received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. The film was praised for its action sequences, music and Dutt's performance, but criticized for its outdated plot, weak screenplay and excessive violence. The film was also affected by Dutt's imprisonment during its release, as he was convicted in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case.
 
Policegiri is available for download in full HD quality with Hindi audio in various formats such as 480p, 720p and 1080p. You can watch the trailer of the film on YouTube or IMDb. You can also watch the full movie online on PogoLinks or other streaming platforms.
  
Policegiri was made on a budget of â¹35 crore and was expected to recover its cost through its theatrical run. However, the film failed to impress the audience and critics alike and performed poorly at the box office. The film collected only â¹9.25 crore in its opening weekend and â¹15.50 crore in its lifetime in India[^1^]. The film also had a dismal performance in overseas markets, collecting only â¹0.75 crore[^3^]. The film was declared a flop by trade analysts.
 
One of the reasons for the film's failure was the absence of its lead actor Sanjay Dutt, who was serving his jail term during the release of the film. Dutt had completed his shooting for the film before going to prison, but he could not promote the film or attend its premiere. The film also faced competition from another release Lootera, which received positive reviews and word-of-mouth publicity. Moreover, the film's outdated plot, weak screenplay and excessive violence did not appeal to the modern audience, who preferred more realistic and engaging cinema.
 
Policegiri was Sanjay Dutt's last film before he went to jail for five years. The film was expected to be a comeback vehicle for him, as he had played similar roles of a tough cop in films like Khalnayak, Vaastav and Dabangg. However, the film failed to live up to the expectations and disappointed his fans. Dutt later returned to films with Bhoomi in 2017, which also flopped at the box office.
  
Despite the negative response from the critics and the audience, Policegiri has some redeeming qualities that make it a watchable film for the fans of Sanjay Dutt and masala entertainers. The film has some catchy songs composed by Himesh Reshammiya and Meet Bros Anjjan, such as "Robinhood", "Chura Ke Leja" and "Tirat Meri Tu". The film also has some impressive action sequences choreographed by Kanal Kannan and Anal Arasu, which showcase Dutt's charisma and style. The film also has some comic relief provided by Rajpal Yadav and Rajat Rawail, who play Dutt's sidekicks.
 
Policegiri also has some decent performances from its supporting cast, especially Prakash Raj, who plays the main antagonist Nagori Subramanium. Raj is known for playing negative roles in films like Singham, Dabangg 2 and Rowdy Rathore, and he does not disappoint in Policegiri either. He brings a menacing and ruthless vibe to his character, who is a corrupt politician and a crime lord. He also has a good chemistry with Dutt, as they engage in a cat-and-mouse game throughout the film. Prachi Desai, who plays Dutt's love interest Sehar, also does a fair job in her role. She looks beautiful and graceful in the film and shares a sweet romance with Dutt.
