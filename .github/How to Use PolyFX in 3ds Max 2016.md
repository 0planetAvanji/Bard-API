## Step 1: Install PolyFX
 
PolyFX is a script that you can download from [ScriptSpot](https://www.scriptspot.com/3ds-max/scripts/polyfx). After downloading the zip file, extract it and copy the PolyFX.mzp file to your 3ds Max scripts folder. Then run 3ds Max and go to **MaxScript > Run Script** and select the PolyFX.mzp file. This will install PolyFX and add it to your **Customize User Interface** dialog.
 
## Step 2: Create an Object and Apply PolyFX
 
Create any object that you want to break into parts and animate. For example, we will create a simple text object with the word "PolyFX". Then go to **Customize > Customize User Interface** and find PolyFX under the **Category > PolyFX**. Drag and drop it to any toolbar or menu. Click on the PolyFX button and select your object. This will apply PolyFX to your object and open the PolyFX settings window.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the Settings
 
In the PolyFX settings window, you can adjust various parameters to control how your object will break and animate. The most important ones are:
 
- **Mode**: This determines how your object will be divided into parts. You can choose from **Face**, **Element**, **Voronoi**, **Slice**, or **Custom**. Each mode has its own sub-options that you can tweak.
- **Animation**: This determines how your parts will move. You can choose from **No Animation**, **Fall Down**, **Fly Away**, **Bounce**, or **Custom Animation**. Each mode has its own sub-options that you can tweak.
- **Noise**: This adds some random variation to the position, rotation, and scale of your parts.
- **Collapse Mode**: This determines how your parts will collapse back to the original object. You can choose from **No Collapse**, **Collapse Backwards**, or **Collapse Forwards**.
- **Display Mode**: This determines how your parts will be displayed in the viewport. You can choose from **Show All Parts**, **Show Only Selected Part**, or **Show Only Animated Parts**.
- **Select Part**: This allows you to select a specific part of your object and modify its settings individually.
- **Create Keyframes**: This creates keyframes for your animation based on the current frame range.
- **Delete Keyframes**: This deletes all keyframes for your animation.
- **Reset Settings**: This resets all settings to their default values.
- **About / Help / Donate / Buy / Update / Uninstall / Close**: These are self-explanatory buttons that provide additional information or actions related to PolyFX.

For example, we will set the Mode to Voronoi with 50 parts, the Animation to Fly Away with Speed of 10, the Noise to Position with Strength of 5, and the Collapse Mode to No Collapse. Then we will create keyframes for our animation.
 
## Step 4: Preview and Render Your Animation
 
To preview your animation, you can use the standard 3ds Max playback controls or scrub the timeline. You can also use the Display Mode to show only animated parts
